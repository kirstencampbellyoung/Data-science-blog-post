Installation 

I have used the Anaconda distribution of Python. There are no additional libraries required to run the code. 

Project Motivation

In this project I made use of an AirBnB dataset from around 2016 to answer the questions for potential AirBnBs listers:
1. Is Seattle a good place for my AirBnB?
2. What amenities do AirBnB guests want?
3. What can I charge for the place I have?
