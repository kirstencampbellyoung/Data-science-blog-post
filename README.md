# Installation 

I have used the Anaconda distribution of Python. There are no additional libraries required to run the code. 

# Project Motivation

In this project I made use of an AirBnB dataset from around 2016 to answer the questions for potential AirBnBs listers:
1. Is Seattle a good place for my AirBnB?
2. What amenities do AirBnB guests want?
3. What can I charge for the place I have? 

# File descriptions

I have the 3 datasets I used -
- Listings.csv
- Calendar.csv
- Reviews.csv

There are 3 notebooks to showcase the work and analysis performed for each of the questions above.
- Question1
- Question2
- Question3

# Results

The findings of my analysis can be found in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@kirstencyoung/so-youre-thinking-of-listing-your-property-on-airbnb-aa542beede47)
